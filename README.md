### Overview
Phased approach: Start with Teams alerts, then build dashboards and advanced monitoring on top of that foundation.

## Phase 1: Teams Alert Foundation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Teams Setup
- **Create dedicated channel**: `#essaybot-alerts` or `#essaybot-monitoring`
- **Set up webhook**: Get the incoming webhook URL
- **Test basic connectivity**: Send a simple test message

### 1.2 Basic Alert Types to Start With
- **Service Health**: Up/down status
- **Error Alerts**: High error rates, critical failures
- **Performance**: Slow response times
- **Resource**: High CPU/memory usage

### 1.3 Simple Monitoring Agent
- **Health checks**: Ping your services every 30 seconds
- **Log monitoring**: Watch for error patterns
- **Basic metrics**: Response times, error counts
- **Teams integration**: Send formatted alerts

## Phase 2: Dashboard Foundation (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Monitoring Stack Setup
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization
- **Alert Manager**: Alert routing and management
- **Node Exporter**: Server metrics collection

### 2.2 Basic Dashboards
- **System Overview**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Application Health**: Response times, error rates, uptime
- **Database**: Connection status, query performance
- **Services**: RAG pipeline, file uploads, authentication

### 2.3 Teams + Dashboard Integration
- **Alert to Dashboard**: Click Teams alert ‚Üí opens relevant dashboard
- **Status Updates**: Dashboard shows current alert status
- **Quick Actions**: Teams buttons to view metrics, restart services

## Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Performance Monitoring
- **API endpoints**: Response time tracking
- **User behavior**: Feature usage, session data
- **Business metrics**: Essays graded, courses created
- **External services**: AWS S3, email service, RAG pipeline

### 3.2 Smart Alerting
- **Alert correlation**: Group related issues
- **Escalation**: Auto-notify if not resolved
- **Suppression**: Prevent alert storms
- **Trending**: Track performance over time

## Phase 4: CI & Regression Detection (Week 7-8)

### 4.1 Performance Baselines
- **Benchmark tests**: API performance, RAG pipeline
- **Regression detection**: Alert on performance drops
- **Trend analysis**: Performance over time

### 4.2 CI Integration
- **Pre-deployment**: Performance checks
- **Post-deployment**: Validation and rollback triggers
- **Performance gates**: Block deployment if metrics degrade

## Why This Order Works

### 1. Teams First = Immediate Value
- You get alerts right away
- Team awareness of issues
- Quick response to problems
- Builds confidence in monitoring

### 2. Dashboard Second = Visual Context
- Teams alerts link to dashboards
- Better understanding of issues
- Historical data and trends
- Team can self-serve information

### 3. Advanced Features = Optimization
- Performance baselines
- Regression detection
- CI integration
- Automated responses

## Teams Alert Examples

### Service Down Alert Essaybot_Monitoring
Alert Monitoring setup for EssayBot


üö® EssayBot API Service Down
Service: EssayBot API Server
Status: Unreachable
Duration: 2 minutes
Action: Check server status

## Performance Alert
‚ö†Ô∏è EssayBot API Slow Response
Service: EssayBot API
Response Time: 4.2s (threshold: 3s)
Endpoint: /api/grade-essay
Duration: 10 minutes


‚ö†Ô∏è High Memory Usage
Service: EssayBot Server
Memory: 85% (threshold: 80%)
Server: essaybot-01
Action: Check for memory leaks

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Teams channel and webhook** (this week)
2. **Create basic monitoring agent** (next week)
3. **Test alert flow** (end of week 2)
4. **Plan dashboard stack** (week 3)

## Questions to Get Started

1. **Teams Channel**: What should we call it? (`#essaybot-alerts`, `#essaybot-monitoring`, etc.)
2. **Initial Alerts**: Which 3-5 alerts would be most valuable to start with?
3. **Team Access**: Who should have access to the monitoring channel?
4. **Response Process**: What's your team's process for handling alerts?

## Expected Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Teams alerts working
- **Week 3-4**: Basic dashboards operational
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced monitoring features
- **Week 7-8**: CI integration and regression detection

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Immediate value**: Get alerts working in a week
- **Incremental**: Build on working foundation
- **Team confidence**: See monitoring value early
- **Scalable**: Easy to add features as you grow
